# WRAP-MCU
[IEEE Wireless, RF, Amplifier Project 2023-2024] C code for STM32 MCU's

## Notes
- A lot of this code is auto-generated by CubeIDE (the IOC HAL settings which tell the MCU which timers, DAC/ADC, op-amps, etc. to use). All files that handle low-level MCU processes (such as `syscalls`, `sysmem`, `system_stm32g4xx`, `stm32g4xx_hal`, `stm32g4xx_it`) are auto-generated.
- The files you'll want to pay attention to are in `Core/Inc` and `Core/Src`. You can tell which sections are user-generated by the comments that say `/* USER CODE BEGIN ... */` and `/* USER CODE END ... */`.

## Installation

1. Download [CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html#get-software).
2. Clone this repo.
3. In CubeIDE, click `Build Project` and see if there are any compilation errors.

There are a lot of steps involved in creating a project for WRAP on your local machine. See the [Getting Started with the MCU](https://www.notion.so/Getting-Started-with-the-MCU-36530f27fd0647b5b578a29198394768?pvs=4) for details.

## Usage
1. Connect all the necessary components on the MCU by following [Testing on the MCUs](https://www.notion.so/Testing-on-the-MCUs-8db58da060734451b70a299593dcbde9?pvs=4).
2. Connect the MCU to your computer and click `Debug Project` or `Run Project`.
